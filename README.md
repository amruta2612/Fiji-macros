# Fiji-macros
Macros written in Fiji/ImageJ for analysis of trajectories in annotated kymographs
In the 'macro with SC lifetime' macro, make sure the total length of the kymograph in pixel is changed 
on line 66 which is currently entered as 444. This has to be changed to = (total
y axis length in pixel - 3) for the respective kymo to be analysed.
